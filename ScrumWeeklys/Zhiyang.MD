## Week 1 oct 27

### What tasks did I work on / complete?<br>
* I worked on greenfoot to develop gumball machine. And got basic understanding of greenfoot

### What am I planning to work on next?<br>
* I will explore greenfoot and unity deeply and considered what game we should do.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?<br>
No Blocker

## Week 2 Nov 3

### What tasks did I work on / complete?<br>
* I explored unity features and greenfoot features. Unity supports 2D &3D and provides friendly user interfaces. But the engine of unity offers a primary scripting API in c# and we are not familiar with it. Greenfoot is based on java, so it can help us develop our game efficiently and quickly.
* I proposed Snake Game because it is easy and very popular.

### What am I planning to work on next?<br>
* We decided South Park Game with greenfoot. I would start working on making use Case , and domain model diagram with team.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?<br>
* Starter code

## Week 3 Nov 10

##### What tasks did I work on / complete?<br>
* Completed Use Case , And Domain Model Diagram. I looked for information about patterns for the game and considered flyweight pattern due to lots of instantiating  enemies and it can save memory to make game run efficiently and quickly.

##### What am I planning to work on next?<br>
* I would learn fly weight pattern and start designing fly weight pattern for the game. 

##### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?<br>
* Blocker Get Github repo access.

## Week 4 Nov 17

### What tasks did I work on / complete?<br>
* Learned flyweight pattern. Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of object state among multiple objects, instead of keeping it in each object. I coded a simple demo of flyweight. Talked about how to integrate code and design patterns.

### What am I planning to work on next?<br>
* I would work on implementing fly weight pattern over enemy factory with instantiating some enemies first in forest world. When need to instantiate new enemies, just pick up from enemies have already created randomly.   

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?<br>
* No blocker.

## Week 5 Nov 24

### What tasks did I work on / complete?<br>
* I implemented fly weight pattern. In forest world, I added new 10 enemies: 5 elves and 5 snakes. When enemies are touched, and just pick them up randomly to add them into the forest world again.

### What am I planning to work on next?<br>
* I would merge it to master, and proposed how to integrate patterns.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?<br>
* Github access.

## Week 6 Nov 29

### What tasks did I work on / complete?<br>
* I combined the fly weight pattern to master. When new enemies needs to be created, just pass parameters; what type of enemy is needed, and factory will provide the preexisting enemy which is not currentl getting used in the world.

### What am I planning to work on next?<br>
* Will work on presentation with team.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?<br>
* No Blocker.
