# XP Values — Courage
When applying the XP methodology, we are responding to change all the time: because of good communication, there are more opportunities for change; because of the simplicity of the system, new changes will bring some redevelopment needs; As feedback is timely, there will be more new requirements to interrupt your thinking.

In short, all this makes you change immediately, so you need to have the courage to face rapid development and face possible redevelopment. Maybe you will think why we have to make our development so messy, but if you don't let it expose early, then it will appear later and will not die. Therefore, XP methodology makes them appear early. Early settlement is a good way to achieve the pace of “small step and fast go” development.
