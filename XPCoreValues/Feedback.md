# XP Core Value : Feedback

## Week 1

* Our first week was spent on choosing game platform, deciding on whether to go with Unity or Greenfoot. Finally we decided to go with Greenfoot as more teammates were familiar with that. Getting feedback from every teammate was important for platform decision. 

* Feedback from every teammate was very important for mutual decision on platform selection. 


## Week 2

* We spent the week 2 on choosing which game to be developed. We started with street fighter. Then we thought we should make a game on basketball. With intense discussion on game selection, we finally decided we should make game on The Stick of Truth. 

* We decided to go with The Stick of Truth, once everyone agreed on it.

## Week 3

*  Patterns were distributed between our members.

* Each team member came up with it's own pattern recommendation. Feedback from other teammates were taken on pattern scope and validation.

* We started with some game development. We also decided to work harder for the next week as we were running behind the schedule. This was validated by our burndown chart.

## Week 4 

* Significant game development happened in this week. 

* Feedback was taken from teammates for correctness of UML diagram.

* We decided that we should drop level 2 in our game and came up with boss battle. 

## Week 5

* Last week was spent on completing our project. Most of game development happened the prior week but refining of game happened on last week.

* We decided to make game tougher by awarding less superpower.
