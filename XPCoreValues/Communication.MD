# XP Core Value : Communication

## Week 1

* Communication is the most important thing for proper functioning of any team. Hence on our first project meeting we have created a whatsapp group. Also we have planned to arrange regular meetings offline or via hangout.

* During this week we all have planned to explore different gaming frameworks. I understand that learning new gaming frameworks can be done easily if everyone shares what they have learned. My target for the next week is to have daily conversation for game ideas, framework and make each team member comfortable to communicate with one another.  


## Week 2

* Everyone proposed their game ideas and shared their knowledge about greenfoot and unity.

* Team has mutually agreed on south park game, and we have started planning and estimating the efforts for this project completion. 


## Week 3

* This week we all are starting on designing the patterns that we can implement in our project. To gel all these patterns together, we need to have robust communication. Hence, we all have decided to have daily discussion for designing for the next week.


## Week 4 

*  Due to strong communication, team has progressed fast in the last week. Every one knew their tasks and stated working on it individually.

* Use of github task board has made it easy to track the tasks.

## Week 5

* During this week we all of us have integrated our individual works and explained what we have implemented.

* We are able to complete our game on time with no issues left.
